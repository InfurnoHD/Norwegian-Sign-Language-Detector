# Tolkern

Welcome to our repository!

## :rocket: Branching Strategy

## `main`

- Must **always** be production ready
- Can **not** be deleted
- Merges to main must pass peer review 
- All changes to main must be through a merge from a branch (due to the above requirement)

## Branching strategy

- For each sprint there will be created a sprint branch 
- This is the branch that will be used for merging during this sprint
- At the end of each sprint, the sprint branch will be merged into `main`

## Branch naming convention

- Branches should include task id in the branch name, exampel: `TOLKERN-1/initial-start`
- Limited lifetime:
  - **Must** be deleted once the work contained within the branch is done, and the branch is merged to `main`
